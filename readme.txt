Fuzzy Evaluation of Chess using Alpha-Beta Pruning
Project by Lux Cardell, Barrett Karstens, and Charles Boudousquie

This project was written using Python 3.7 and python-chess 0.28.3.

To perform first-time setup, run "make setup". This will install the chess library for python.

To run the program, run "make run". The program will play a game of chess, using the standard chess evaluation function for White and our fuzzy evaluation function for Black.
