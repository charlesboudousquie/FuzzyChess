Fuzzy Evaluation of Chess using Alpha-Beta Pruning
Project by Lux Cardell, Barrett Karstens, and Charles Boudousquie

This project was written using Python 3.7 and python-chess 0.28.3.

To perform first-time setup, run "make setup". This will install the chess library for python.

To run the program, run "make run". The program will list the valid moves for the board state and offer an input field. 

At any time during gameplay, the evaluation method can be changed by entering "mam" for Mamdani, "ts" for Takagi-Sugeno, or "std" for the standard chess evaluation function.
